# some-random-project
Vue what I have built ðŸ˜‰.  This project was initialized with Vue CLI. 


## Goals for this project
This is my attempt at putting a Vue.js project together.  I'll hopefully have a functional app that uses the most common Vue features, a data store, and routing.  Connecting this app to a functional backend would be a big plus.


## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
