# Tum Grum Chief

Vue what I have built ðŸ˜‰. This project was initialized with Vue CLI.... So I can't take credit for setting everything up ðŸ˜….

## Goals for this project

This is my attempt at putting a Vue.js project together. I'll hopefully have a functional app that uses the most common Vue features, a data store, and routing. Connecting this app to a functional backend would be a big plus.

#### MVP

- [x] Create site that searches for recipes based on the users search criteria
- [x] Get API key
- [x] Create search bar component
- [x] Create card for search results
- [x] Add more than one filter option that is optional
- [x] Add loading icon when we are searching for results

- [] Add pagination
- [] When a user selects a recipe, show a more details view of their selection
- [] Create user account so that user's recipe's can be saved and notes can be added.
